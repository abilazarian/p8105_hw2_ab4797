# Problem 1

\_ Import and Clean Trash Wheel
Data

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("data/trash_wheel_updated.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% 
rename ("weight" = weight_tons, "volume" = volume_cubic_yards)
```

\_ Import and Clean Precipitation data 2018 and adding the variable
‘Year’

``` r
precip_18 = read_excel("data/trash_wheel_updated.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

\_ Import and Clean Precipitation data 2017 and adding the variable
‘Year’

``` r
precip_17 = read_excel("data/trash_wheel_updated.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate (year = 2017) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) 

precip_1718 = bind_rows(precip_17, precip_18)
```

\_ Dataset Description

This is a publicly available dataset showing us data regarding trash
collected from Baltimore’s inner harbor. To understand the amount of
precipitation from 2017-2018, we combined two data sets. In total there
are 24 observations in the combined resulting datasets. In the dataset
precipitation for 2017 there are 12 and in the dataset for 2018 there
are 12. The final dataset has 3 number of columns, and the key variables
represented are Month, Year, and Total Precipitation in inches. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 The median number of sportsballs
in a dumpster in 2017 was 8

# Problem 2

\_ Import and Clean Pols
data

``` r
pols_month = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv", col_types = "cciiiciii") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  rename("gop" = prez_gop, "dem" = prez_dem) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

\_ Import and Clean SNP data

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/snp.csv", col_types = "cd") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate("date", into = c("day", "month", "year")) %>% 
  select("year", "month", "day", "close") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

\_ Import and Clean Unemployment
data

``` r
unemployment_data = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv", col_types = "cdddddddddddd") %>%     janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer (jan:dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "count") 
```

\_ Merge SNP, Pols, and Unemployment Data

``` r
snp_pols_merge = left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("month", "year"))
snp_pols_unemployment_merge = left_join(snp_pols_merge, unemployment_data, by = c("month", "year"))
```

\_ Dataset Description

This merged data comes from multiple datasets used to indicate when
researchers may “p-hack” as a means of finding significant results (a
very not cool thing to do\!). The “pols-month” data contains
observations regarding the number of politicians who are democratic or
republican. The S\&P data represents a measure of the stock market as a
whole, and Unemployment data refers to the number of people unemployed
at any given time. After SNP, Unemployment, and Pols datasets were
merged, the dataset resulted in 1391 total observations. The range of
years in this new dataset is 1947, 2015. Lastly, key variable names
which we want to include are year, month, gop, gov\_gop, sen\_gop,
rep\_gop, dem, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, close, count.

# PROBLEM 3

\_ Import and Clean Baby Names
data

``` r
babynames_data_1 = read_csv("./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv", col_types = "dcccii") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate_all(toupper) %>% 
  rename("year" = year_of_birth, "name" = childs_first_name) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "BLACK NON HISP", "BLACK NON HISPANIC")) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP", "WHITE NON HISPANIC")) %>% 
 mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "ASIAN AND PACI", "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER")) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))  %>% 
  mutate(rank = as.numeric(rank)) %>% 
  mutate (count = as.numeric(count))
```

\_ Table showing rank of the name “Olivia”

This table shows the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female
baby name over time according to ethnicities.

``` r
babynames_data_1 %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(name == "OLIVIA") %>% 
  select ("year", "ethnicity", "rank") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "rank") %>% 
  knitr:: kable(digits = 1) 
```

| ethnicity                  | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 |
| :------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER |    1 |    1 |    1 |    3 |    3 |    4 |
| BLACK NON HISPANIC         |    8 |    4 |    8 |    6 |    8 |   10 |
| HISPANIC                   |   13 |   16 |   16 |   22 |   22 |   18 |
| WHITE NON HISPANIC         |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    4 |    2 |

\_ Table showing most popular name among male children over time

This table shows the most popular name among male children over time
according to various ethnicities. The real question we are not asking
is… who is naming their child “Liam”? No offense.

``` r
babynames_data_1 %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(gender == "MALE", rank == "1") %>% 
  select (year, ethnicity, rank, name) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "name") %>% 
  knitr:: kable(digits = 1) 
```

| ethnicity                  | rank | 2016   | 2015   | 2014   | 2013   | 2012   | 2011    |
| :------------------------- | ---: | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :------ |
| ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER |    1 | ETHAN  | JAYDEN | JAYDEN | JAYDEN | RYAN   | ETHAN   |
| BLACK NON HISPANIC         |    1 | NOAH   | NOAH   | ETHAN  | ETHAN  | JAYDEN | JAYDEN  |
| HISPANIC                   |    1 | LIAM   | LIAM   | LIAM   | JAYDEN | JAYDEN | JAYDEN  |
| WHITE NON HISPANIC         |    1 | JOSEPH | DAVID  | JOSEPH | DAVID  | JOSEPH | MICHAEL |

\_ Scatterplot

This scatterplot shows the number of children with a name against the
rank in popularity of that name for the year 2016. It took me about 4
hours to make, I hope you enjoy\!

``` r
library(ggridges)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'ggridges'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':
    ## 
    ##     scale_discrete_manual

``` r
babynames_data_plot = filter(babynames_data_1, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC", 
                             gender == "MALE", year == "2016") 

ggplot(babynames_data_plot, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + geom_point() 
```
