# Problem 1

\_ Import and Clean Trash Wheel
Data

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("data/trash_wheel_updated.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% 
rename ("weight" = weight_tons, "volume" = volume_cubic_yards)
```

\_ Import and Clean Precipitation data 2018 and adding the variable
‘Year’

``` r
precip_18 = read_excel("data/trash_wheel_updated.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

\_ Import and Clean Precipitation data 2017 and adding the variable
‘Year’

``` r
precip_17 = read_excel("data/trash_wheel_updated.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate (year = 2017) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) 

precip_1718 = bind_rows(precip_17, precip_18)
```

\_ Dataset Description

This is a publicly available dataset showing us data regarding trash
collected from Baltimore’s inner harbor. To understand the amount of
precipitation from 2017-2018, we combined two data sets. In total there
are 24 observations in the combined resulting datasets. In the dataset
precipitation for 2017 there are 12 and in the dataset for 2018 there
are 12. The final dataset has 3 number of columns, and the key variables
represented are Month, Year, and Total Precipitation in inches. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 The median number of sportsballs
in a dumpster in 2017 was 8

# Problem 2

\_ Import and Clean Pols
data

``` r
pols_month = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv", col_types = "cciiiciii") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate("mon", into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  rename("gop" = prez_gop, "dem" = prez_dem) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

\_ Import and Clean SNP data

``` r
snp = read_csv("./data/snp.csv", col_types = "cd") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate("date", into = c("day", "month", "year")) %>% 
  select("year", "month", "day", "close") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

\_ Import and Clean Unemployment
data

``` r
unemployment_data = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv", col_types = "cdddddddddddd") %>%     janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer (jan:dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "count") 
```
